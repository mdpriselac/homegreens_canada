Our goal is straightforward: make it easy to find and compare green coffees for sale in Canada. Below you will find a description of what you can find and do here wit the information we have gathered and studied.

### A Single List

We've scoured the internet and many of the most reputable green sellers in Canada to put together a list of all green coffees currently for sale from these sellers. The list is available via the All Green Coffees option in the navigation bar to the left. You can sort coffees by origin, seller, and whether or not the coffee is still for sale. Shortly you'll be able to sort by arrival date as well. You can find a list of which sellers we're following in the about our data collection tab above.

### Overall Data on New Arrivals

In the Fresh Arrival tab you can see which origins have been added to green seller websites in the past 30 days. This aggegated information can give us info about which countries are delivering more fresh coffees than usual and so some insight into which coffees from which sellers are likely to be fresher than others.

### Individual Coffee

You can acess individual coffees for sale through the Individual Coffee Information page. When browsing the full data set in All Green Coffees you can select a coffee with the far left hand column, to the left of the row number, and go to the individual page with further details about the coffee by clicking on the button below the dataset. Each individual coffee page has a dynamically generated flavor wheel based on the flavor notes from the green seller. We'll soon be adding a section to each individual coffee page that shows the five most similar coffees based on location and flavor ntoes.

### About our Data Collection, Processing and Quality Estimates

At the top of this page you can find lots of information about how we're collecting, processing and using data from green seller websites. We're trying our best to standardize and make uniform the very diverse information that sellers put on their websites. Depending on the information category, we're using a range of tools from LLMs, to simple natural language processing metrics, to simpler processing patterns. Read more about that in the About our Data Processing tab abvove. 

Once the data is homogenized we're having some fun with it that you may or may not find interesting. We've trained a very basic model to predict [Coffee Review](https://wwww.coffeereview.com) ratings based on country of origin and flavor notes (the 'Blind Assessment' text from Coffee Review review). With that model in hand we can look at some aggeregate data about the coffees currently for sale, like which origins are likelier to produce higher rating coffees, which flavor notes are more closely associated with higher ratings, etc. In service of that we've also adapted the SCAA flavor wheel to be a bit more friendly for our LLM and prediction tools to work with. You can find more information above.

Over time we'll build our models up to take into account more detailed information about coffees like growing elevation and varietals.
