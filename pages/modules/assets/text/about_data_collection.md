### Methods
Data is collected from public facing websites using standard webscraping approaches.
### Frequency
We do not want to create any special burden on coffee seller websites. We will only be scraping websites once per week. Do not expect to see a coffee here immediately after it appears on a seller website because we are not constantly monitoring coffee sellers.
### Information Collected
Our goal is to collect as much information as we can about an individual coffee related to:

- Origin Location information: Country, Region, any other more fine grained information about the location.
- Growing altitude
- Varietals
- Cupping Score
- Tasting notes
- The date we first observed a coffee on a seller's website.
- Whether the listing is 'expired' or not. That is, whether the link for the coffee is currently active. If it isn't, the coffee is listed as expired.

Most importantly we're not collecting information about price. The goal here is not to create more competition pressures on green sellers by having their prices directly comparable in a single location. It's easy enough to compare prices once you find coffees that look similar enough by the data that we have collected.

### How the information is used
After collecting the information we're processing it to make it as uniform as possible across different sellers. For more information on how the information is process and transformed see the About our Data Processing tab on this page.

The processed data is available on the 'All Green Coffees' page.

Information about individual coffees is available at the Individual Coffees page, or by clicking on the id number of the green coffee on the All Green Coffees page. On individual coffee pages you can see more detail about each coffee included versions of the data collected before processing. This 'raw' collected information is most likely to be interesting when it comes to flavors. Individual coffee pages also display a flavor wheel for each coffee where the processed flavor notes are represented on a flavor wheel derived from the SCAA flavor wheel. More infomration about the flavor wheel is available on the About our Flavor Wheel tab on this page. Individual pages will also soon have a list of the 10 most similar coffees to the current coffee page, based on flavor notes and origin.

In addition to data processing, we're also using the data collected for some fun with predictions. After collecting coffee reviews from the internet, we've created a model for predicting approximate score ranges based on the flavor notes provided by the seller. See the About our Predictions page for more information about how the model was constructed, what is interesting about it, and how it should not be interpreted.
